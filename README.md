# COVID-19-Mine-Seeker
Configurable options for the number of rows, columns, and the ammount of mines per game.
1. User initially sees the game board with all cells hidden.
2. User selects a cell. If it has a mine, then the mine is revealed.
3. When the user taps a cell without a hidden mine, it triggers a scan of that cell's row and column. The cell then displays the number of hidden mines found in its row and column.
4. Using the information from the scans, the user can make informed choices about which cells to investigate.
5. Once the user has found all the mines, they win the game. The challenge is winning with the fewest scans. Note that revealing a mine does not count as a scan however, scanning on a revealed mine (by tapping an already revealed mine) does trigger a scan and counts as a scan.
